## Gender quotas

1. Araújo, C., & Alves, J. E. D. (2007). Impactos de indicadores sociais e do sistema eleitoral sobre as chances das mulheres nas eleições e suas interações com as cotas. Dados, 50(3), 535-577.

  - The quotas were implemented but the percentage of female representatives is still low
  - Some reasons for this: lack of enforcement, increase in the number of candidates per party
  - An open puzzle is how some countries without the gender quotas manage to have more female elected. Other countries who also have quotas but have some form of punishment for parties who fail to met the minimum percentage of candidates also performs better
  - There might be a relation with the voting system (in Brazil: proportional representation with open list)
  - Some socio economic variables from the region might also influence
  - Proportional systems tend to facilitate feminine elections. There is no consensus about the type of list (open x closed): there exist supporting arguments for both.
  
2. Dodson, D. L. (2006). The impact of women in Congress. OUP Oxford.

  - Having more women elected does not necessarily means better representation (_but this is not going to be my focus here_)
  - There was naturally an expansion in the number of female elected in the US, without a gender quota bill
  
3. Araújo, C. (2003, February). Quotas for women in the Brazilian legislative system. In International IDEA Workshop “The Implementation of Quotas: Latin American Experiences,” Lima, Peru, February (pp. 23-24).

  - Has some interesting data from the 90's including percentagtes of women elected
  - There is a good explanation on how the Brazilian political system is organized

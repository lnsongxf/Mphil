# Some lose ideas

(Auraújo & Alves, 2007)
- There is evidence of what makes the gender quota to be effective in increasing female participation:
    - Sanctions do parties who don't met the minimum percentages of female candidates
    - Strong feminist movement in the country
    - Some socioeconomic characteristics of the population
- Some limitations
    - It is possible that the open list format is not privileging women enought as it would be in the case of closes list
    - The size of the party might influence the outcome, specially in the open list case - but I don't think I will look into this variable
    
# Research question

- Was there an effect of the gender quota in Brazil to increase the number of _elected_ councilwomen?
  - Was this different for different groups (eg race)?
  - Was this different for different regions (geographic regions in Brazil)?
  - Was this different depending on socioeconomic characteristics of the municipalities?
  - Is this different depending on the schooling profile of the candidate?
  - Density of candidates has an impact in female outcomes?

## To-do :dart:

### Coding

* Make a comparison between municipalities where parity was already achieved in the elections before
* Maybe compare the effects of the 1997's bill with the one from 2009
* Gini Index and HDI;
* Look for cities that have only 3 periods (probably new municipalities) and remove them from the data base;
* See if the counting of votes is being done correctly.

### Text
* Download papers;
* See if anything new popped up recently;
* Find some bayesian references for DiD;
* Improve the introduction with more content about gender equality in parliaments;
* Improve the Brazil's electoral system explanation as well improve the literature review for this part;
* Add some review of studies that evaluated the gender quota with econometric methods;
* Improve the covariates explanation, trying to relate with other studies to justify them;
* Analyze the region's differences (based on http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ref/v14n2/a03v14n2.pdf);
* Read carefully Hughes article (The increasing effectiveness of national gender quotas);

### Stretch goals
  * Try to incorporate info from the 2000 census and suppose that this refers to "pre-quota" period. Use 2010 census data only for the 2012 and 2016 observations. Estimate a first difference model;
  * Analyze the "phantom candidates": women candidates without votes;
  * Analyze the flutuation in number of votes to female candidates: since the city council offices are based on proportional elections system;

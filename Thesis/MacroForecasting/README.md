# Meaningful macroeconomic forecasting

## Problem description

The problems of parameter inference and forecasting are usually treated differently in the literature. A model that can produce very realiable out-of-sample forecasting not necessarily would be optimal for parameter estimate. There seems to be a trade off between being able to explain the economy and being able to predict what will be the future movements of macroeconomic aggregates.
One complication that arises from this trade-off is the lack of explanation for the forecasting results. Forecast analysis is done by the policy maker to justify actions (or lack of actions), but if the forecast is resulting from a data-driven model without any economic structure, it could be hard to justify the policy decisions or even determine what should be a policy.

## Proposed solution

The goal is to reconcile data-driven models with models with microfoundations to provide some economic meaning to forecasts.

## Team members :dancers:
Antonia Kurz and Aishameriane Schmidt.

## Requirements :computer:

Matlab R2019b.

## LaTeX report

See [here](https://github.com/AdvancedTopicsInMacroI/problem-set-3-aisha-antonia/blob/master/Report_Aisha_Antonia_HW3.pdf).

## Remarks :exclamation:

We only solved question 2. The loglinearized solution gave us an explosive (:boom:) solution according to the eigenvalues of the matrix H from the method of undetermined coefficients.

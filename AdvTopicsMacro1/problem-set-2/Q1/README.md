## Aisha

I cleaned up a bit and implemented simulation for Tauchen's. I increased N to see if it seems ok, and the thing with importante sampling seems fine. The one with the Equidistant grid seems to have a way different standard deviation (try with N=1000). There is a small table at the end. I do have some ideas for the second method.

Rouwenhorst is working and also simulates, but **I am not confident on the way I made the grid.**

The averages (Table 1) seems a little off for the three methods.

## Requirements :computer:

Matlab R2019b.

## LaTeX report

See [here](https://github.com/AdvancedTopicsInMacroI/problem-set-1-aishameriane/blob/master/Homework_1_Adv_Topics_in_Macro_1___03112020.pdf).

## Remarks

For question 1, the Howard's policy method is in a separate file. We didn't have time to merge them all.

## To-do list :dart:

- [X] Start repository
- [X] First meeting to discuss the tasks and workflow
- [X] Create an Overleaf document
- [:construction:] Problem 1
    - Value function iteration: [X] Code [X] LaTeX
    - Policy function + monotonicity: [X] Code [X] LaTeX
    - Value function + concavity: [X] Code [X] LaTeX
    - Howard's policy iteration: [X] Code [X] LaTeX
    - Algorithm's performance: [X] Code [X] LaTeX
 - [X] Problem 2
    - [X] a) Calculate the SS
    - [ ] b) Double TFP and compute the new SS and transition path over 200 periods. Compute the transition in three different ways: 
        [X] b1) 200 equations + unknowns; 
        [X] b2) guessing 1st period capital; 
        [nop] b3) guessing final capital.
       for all, record time.
- [ ] Problem 3 (optional)
    - [ ] Linear interpolation
- [ ] Problem 4 (optional)
    - [ ] Show that the bissection method converges linearly at a rate of 1/2
- [ ] Problem 5 - solve sin 2pix - 2x = 0 (optional)
    - [ ] Using bisection
    - [ ] Using Newton's method
    - [ ] Using the secant method
    - [ ] Using the fixed point iteration
    - [ ] Verify for which initial values you have convergence
    - [ ] Repeat for 2pix - x = 0 and sin 2pi x - 0.5x=0
